## Goal: To learn how to hook up a database to my web projects


### Steps taken in this project
1. Install all dependencies and devDependencies using npm install
    - Change scripts within package.json
2. Import libraries for server files, setup layouts, ports, install dotenv for security
3. Setup MongoDB, hook it up to Heroku server
4. Create routes and pages for authors
5. Create partials for the header. Basically a template header for every page instead of having to put it each individual page. 
6. Create model for author
7. Create _form_fields to import pieces of html from here instead of having it copied on every page
