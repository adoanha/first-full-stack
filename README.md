This web application is a database where you can store information about books. You may add your own authors and books, and you can query books that you've already entered.

## Goal: To learn how to hook up a database to my web projects

### First Steps
1. Install all dependencies and devDependencies using npm install
    - Change scripts within package.json
2. Import libraries for server files, setup layouts, ports, install dotenv for security
3. Setup MongoDB, hook it up to Heroku server
4. Create partials for the header. Basically a template header for every page instead of having to put it each individual page. 

### Author
1. Create route and pages for authors
2. Create model for author
3. Create _form_fields to import pieces of html from here instead of having it copied on every page

### Books
1. Create route and pages for books
    - Index
    - New
2. Create model for book
3. Create_form_fields
4. Install multer library to help store cover image into our model
